## Overview
KeePass is a password manager which helps you to manage your passwords in a secure way. You can put all of your
passwords in one database, which is locked with one master key or a key file. So you only have to remember one single
master password or select the key file to unlock the whole database. The databases are encrypted using the best and
most secure encryption algorithms currently known.

You can have multiple databases to keep account information separate. For example, you can have one database for work passwords and another database for personal passwords.

## Create Your First KeePass Database
1. Open KeePass under Start > All Programs > KeePass Pasword Safe.
2. You will be prompted to select a location to save your Keepass database file. Choose a location and click Save when finished.
3. To create a database for your passwords, click File > New. This will prompt you to choose a master password. Place a check next to the Master password box and enter your password. Retype your password in the Repeat password box. Click OK when you are finished.

If you use a master password, you only have to remember one password or passphrase. Please note the following:
- If you forget this master password, all of your other passwords in the database are lost too.
- There isn't any backdoor or a key which can open all databases.
- There is no way of recovering your passwords.
- The stronger the password, the more safe it is.
- Choose a strong password that you will remember.

4. A Database Settings screen will appear. Enter a name for your database. There are various other preferences that you can set on the tabs. Once finished, click OK.
5. Now can start entering accounts and passwords. Select a category from the right-hand panel (General, Windows, Network, Internet, eMail, or Homebanking). Then choose Edit > Add Entry. 
6. A new window will appear asking you to create a new password entry. Fill in as much information as you'd like KeePass to store for you including username, password, web address, security questions and more. KeePass will automatically generate a random password in the fields; delete these fields and enter your own if youâ€™d like.
7. Save your database before closing KeePass. 

## Open an Existing Database
- To open an existing database with KeePass open, click File > Open and search for your KeePass database. This will prompt you for your Master Password which will gain you access to your other passwords. 
- To open an existing database without KeePass open, browse to the database file ending in .kdbx and double click it. This will open KeePass and prompt you for your Master password.

## Using KeePass
- To search for an entry, use the display box at the top of the window to enter a keyword. Matches will appear in the main screen.
- To copy a username or password to the Clipboard for use in other programs, right click on the entry and select Copy User Name or Copy Password. You have 12 seconds to complete the Copy/Paste transaction before the Username or Password is deleted from the clipboard. 

## Password Best Practices
Different systems will each have their own unique password requirements. Our network requires 6 character
minimum passwords. Also, to ensure that you have a strong password, at least 2 of the following 4 character types
should be included in your password.

- Uppercase characters (A through Z)
- Lowercase characters (a through z)
- Numerals (0 through 9)
- Non-alphabetic characters (such as: ! $ # % [ ] etc.)

Also, the password cannot contain your account or full name. Adhering to these guidelines will guarantee that you
meet the minimum complexity and length requirements for each system. It will also help to ensure that you select a
password that is difficult for others to guess.
